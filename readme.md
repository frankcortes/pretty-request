#PrettyRequest

HTTP requests are too many long often. PrettyRequest is a tiny online web tool to display the different parameters for these requests easier. <br />
This web platform is hosted in Github, and it is using now: <br />

-   Vanilla **BackboneJS**
-   **RequireJS** as AMD loader
-   **Handlebars** as template engine
-   **Zepto**
-   **Coffeescript**
-   **Pure CSS**, combined with Bootstrap Model.
-   **Grunt** as task runner.

Pull Requests and suggestions are welcome. Enjoy using it!
