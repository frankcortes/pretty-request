#PrettyRequest

<p>HTTP requests are too many long often. PrettyRequest is a tiny online web tool to display the different parameters for these requests easier. <br />
This web platform is hosted in Github, and it is using:

* Vanilla _BackboneJS_
* _RequireJS_ as AMD loader
* _Handlebars_ as template engine
* _Zepto_
* _Coffeescript_
* _Pure CSS_, combined with Bootstrap Model.
* _Grunt_ as task runner.

Pull Requests and suggestions are welcome. Enjoy using it!
